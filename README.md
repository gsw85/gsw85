# Hi there, I'm Dr. Goh Shu Wei 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a tech enthusiast passionate about artificial intelligence, open-source projects, and innovative solutions. I started learning programming later in life and love to tell people that it’s "Never too old to program."

## A Little About Me

I’ve had an exciting journey in the tech world, contributing to the growth of AI and ecosystem building. In my early days, I contributed to the development of transportation materials, focusing on Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA), Rubber Asphalt, Nanotechnology in Asphalt, and Asphalt Pavement lifecycle prediction.
